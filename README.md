# Task Requirements

##### I was required to implement a task manager which has the following :
<ul> 
<li>  Create an HTML document that includes an input field for entering task names and a button to add tasks.
</li>
<li> Display the list of tasks on the webpage. </li>
 <li>Each task should have options to mark it as completed and delete it. </li>
 <li> When a user enters a task name and clicks the "Add" button, the task should be added to the list.   </li>
 <li>   Users should be able to delete tasks by clicking a delete button associated with each task. </li>
 <li> Users should be able to mark tasks as completed or active by clicking on them.   </li>
 <li>Implement validation to ensure that users cannot add empty tasks.</li>
 <li>   Allow users to edit task names. </li>
 <li>  Write well-structured, modular, and commented code. </li>
 <li>   Follow best practices for naming variables and functions. </li>

</ul>

###  BONUS : 
<ul> 
<li> Implement a filter or search bar that allows users to filter tasks by their status (e.g., all tasks, completed tasks, or active tasks).</li>
<li> Add due dates and priorities to tasks.
</li>
</ul>

##### Deliverable was a GitHub link. Make the UI catchy and attractive to the eye no matter how simple the application is.
